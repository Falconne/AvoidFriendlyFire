        <content>Shooters will no longer worry about pawns wearing a shield belt with at least 10% power standing in the line of fire. You can now attack with shielded infantry while ranged troops continue to fire over them from behind. If the shield drops below 10% power while the pawn is still subject to friendly fire, then the shooters will stop. They will resume shooting after the shield gets above 10%. This behaviour can be disabled from the mod options if needed.</content>

        <content>Added a setting in Mod Options to always enable 'Avoid FF' status on a pawn when it's undrafted. If you tend to disable the 'Avoid FF' setting on pawns during combat, using this option will ensure it is always turned back on again before the next combat. This new option is off by default.</content>

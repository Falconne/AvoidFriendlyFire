        <content>Shooters will no longer worry about pawns wearing a shield belt with at least 10% power standing in the line of fire. You can now attack with shielded infantry while ranged troops continue to fire over them from behind. If the shield drops below 10% power while the pawn is still subject to friendly fire, then the shooters will stop. They will resume shooting after the shield gets above 10%. This behaviour can be disabled from the mod options if needed.</content>
